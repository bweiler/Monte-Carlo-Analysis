The law of large numbers states that individual random events converge on a set percentage based on reptition. For example, a coin toss will converge more and more perfectly on 50/50 with a greater number of trials. 

This was also the motivation for Markov Processes, where the underlying probablities are not completely random.

This application is a battle between two game characters with different parameters. One is more powerful with stronger attacks and greater health. The take turns attacking, using as many battles (rounds) as neccessary for one to perish.

Since the parameters change based on distance bewteen them (far, middle - ranged, close - melee), three sets of parameters are simulated.

For example, at 12" ranged attacks, the number of deaths converges approximatel-minmal at 100000 battles: Character 1 at 15.32%, and characater 2 at 7.66%

Greater numnber of battles only refines in the percentage in the hundreths, with some variance.
